Synopsis
--------

  This library provides a generic driver for applications
  that want to do I/O real fast. The driver does all the
  tedious things involved in block-oriented I/O (like buffer
  management), and uses a "callback function" to process the
  data it has read. The idea is that all you have to write
  is a ``BlockHandler``, which does no I/O at all but just
  processes the data as it comes in.
