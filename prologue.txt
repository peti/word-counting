This library provides a generic driver for applications that
want to do I\/O real fast. The driver does all the tedious
things involved in block-oriented I\/O (like buffer
management), and uses a \"callback function\" to process the
data it has read. The idea is that all you have to write is
a 'System.IO.Driver.BlockHandler', which does no I\/O at all
but just processes the data as it comes in.
